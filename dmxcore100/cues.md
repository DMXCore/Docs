This is a list of all the cues stored in the system. Tap it to instantly start the playback. Long-hold a cue to access the settings for that cue where you can modify the code, name, and delete the cue. ![image](https://github.com/DMXCore/DmxCore100/assets/407941/894bb4c4-7262-40f5-a259-ce9d88f1e65d)

The `code` is used in API trigger events. Cues are stored as Wireshark PCAP files internally and can be either ArtNet or sACN, but will be converted during playback if the output protocol is different than the cue.
