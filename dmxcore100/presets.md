All presets stores on the DMX Core 100 will be listed here. You can simply tap one to activate it. If a cue is playing then it will be stopped when a preset is selected. See this page for details about blackout and stop.

A preset with a single universe will be outputted to all configured universes when selected. A multi-universe preset will only output to the number of universes that are stored in the preset.

Long-hold an item to access the settings for the preset. ![image](https://github.com/DMXCore/DmxCore100/assets/407941/b8aad18d-c646-4789-ac08-835da366dfee) Here you can edit the code (which is used in API calls), name and delete the preset. ![image](https://github.com/DMXCore/DmxCore100/assets/407941/187bc4ff-33f9-4cd6-8a12-eebfc8ff1f56)
