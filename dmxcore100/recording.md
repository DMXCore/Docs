Press **Preview** to start the listening of ArtNet or sACN packets (depending on output configuration). The universe ids are taken from the output configuration. Any active playback will be stopped.

You'll see a graphical representation of all the DMX channels per universes during preview: ![image](https://github.com/DMXCore/DmxCore100/assets/407941/e7ec4b68-f3d3-478c-bbce-c35101c30d52)

Use the **Stop** button to stop preview (without capturing anything). While previewing you can either record a snapshot (Preset), or a cue (show). Once recorded you save it by clicking the **Save** button. You can later go back to the presets/cues and rename them.
