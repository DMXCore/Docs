#### How many universes can the DMX Core 100 support?

You can output up to 100 universes at 40 Hz. It's possible to run more in some scenarios.

#### Can the DMX Core 100 run offline/disconnected?

Yes, the DMX Core 100 can run without Internet access, but will not receive software updates. It is however possible to temporarily move it over to a network with internet access to receive updates as it will attempt to connect to the cloud platform to receive updates.

#### Can the DMX Core 100 be configured for static IP?

The DMX Core 100 is configured for DHCP as default, but it is possible to change to a static IP, however that process is currently not exposed in the UI and has to be done manually. Please contact us for more details.
