Here are all the settings you can change for a schedule.

* _Name_ - name of the schedule
* _Enabled_ - turn on/off the schedule
* _Override_ - if turned on then this schedule will override all other schedules for the same period
* _Start Date_ - when the schedule starts
* _End Date_ - optional end date for when the schedule ends (inclusive)
* _Days_ - set the schedule to run on the selected day of week
* _Start Time_ - time of day when the schedule starts
* _End Time_ - optional end time for when the schedule ends. Note that a cue playback may end before the scheduled end time
* _Output_ - which output the schedule will use (if multiple)
* _Type_ - type of event (pattern, cue, preset)
* _Play_ - what will be played at the scheduled event

**Delete Schedule** will delete the schedule from the system. Note that changes to the schedule don't take effect until you exit out of the schedule settings screen. Also schedules are only triggered on whole minutes (so 8:00:00, 8:01:00, 8:02:00 and so on).
