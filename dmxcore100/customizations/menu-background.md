# Menu Background

You can upload an image that will be used as a background of all menus. The file name is `menu-background` and it can either be PNG or JPG. The size of the background is 800x389, however the device will scale any uploaded image to fit. You upload the image under the Web Admin UI under File Explorer/Images.
