# Main/Home screen logo

You can replace the main DMX Core logo (displayed on the home screen) by uploading an image in the Web Admin UI under File Explorer. The file should be named `home-logo` and can be either PNG or JPG. The native size is 800x300, but the DMX Core 100 will resize any uploaded image to fit.
